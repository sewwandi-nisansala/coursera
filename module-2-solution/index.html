                <p>The campaign was launched the week of May 18, 1992 by the Chicago-based National Livestock and
                    Meat Board through a promotional arm, "The Beef Industry Council", by the advertising 
                    firm of Leo Burnett Company. The "Beef. It's What's For Dinner" campaign was
                    established through television and radio advertisements that featured actor Robert
                    Mitchum as its first narrator, and scenarios and music ("Hoe-Down") from the Rodeo
                    suite by Aaron Copland, followed by a large magazine campaign that was rolled out
                    in late July and early August.</p>

                <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared
                     vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying 
                     a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally 
                     tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
                      ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).

                    Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared 
                    with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as 
                    squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are 
                    vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon 
                    radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
